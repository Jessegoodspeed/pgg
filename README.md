# Public Goods Game (PGG) Simulation

The Public Goods Game (PGG) is a standard game from experimental economics, where $n$ players that start with equal endowments must choose individually how much of their endowment to contribute to a collective pot. The pot is then multiplied by an arbitrary factor between 1 and $n$ and divided evenly among the players as a payout. This game is typically played across multiple rounds. In our simulations, we set $n$ to 5, the multiplicative factor is 1.2, and each game is played for a total of 10 rounds.
